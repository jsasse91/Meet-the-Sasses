                so we kept it. Loki loves squeeky toys and long walks.</td>
            <td width="33.3%">Jill, our slightly less mischievious pup. Like Loki, her name was given prior to adoption as she 
                was found with another dog as a stray, so they were named after Jack and Jill. Jill loves cuddling under blankets 
                and getting all of the pets.</td>
